# Pull Requests - Rules
## General
- ONLY signed and verified commits
- ONLY from your name
- DO NOT commit with `codex` or `claude` as author/commiter
- PREFER `flow` branch for development, not `main`

## AI
We are not against modern tools, like AI, where you act as a principal or architect, but we consider it important:

- you really understand what you're doing
- you understand the relationships and dependencies of the components being modified
- you understand the architecture of Telegram MTProto, MTProxy, Middle-End KDF at least generically
- you DO NOT commit for the sake of commits, but to help the community, core-developers and ordinary users
